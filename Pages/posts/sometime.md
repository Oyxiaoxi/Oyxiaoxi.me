Sometimes, It’s not the person miss, It’s the feeling you had when you were with them.

Pay attention to the details to the small things, Sometimes the small beauty in your life can make such a huge difference. Especially during a difficult time like this.

This life is not only about discovering what is unknown is this world It’s also about discovering yourself to understand who you are !

If you’ve got 80% or 60% accurate information Which is already 100% sufficient to make the decision I mean, That’s good enough, right!

Diagnosis, analysis, development of strategies, and actual action plan.

The perception would be the foundation  to build your Emotional/affective & cognitive understanding of the world. so that’s the basic components of developing your Learning process and memory, attitude and behaviours.

Hospitality is based on the assumption that hosts are doing this on a good will And of course they are looking for Some exchange from the guests And Hopefully develop everything into a long-term relationship.

When you look at the stars you just realise how small you are, All the troubles, All that stress, Everything that troubles you in your life. You don’t need to worry about those ones, So urh Think big.
