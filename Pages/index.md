Hi there, I am Oyxiaoxi, a Chinese freelance Full Stack Developer.

Thanks to My friends, I have been asked to work as a remote technical consultant to solve some tricky, complex space, server and underlying code logic work.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/Oyxiaoxi). If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in BeiJing or Shanghai or Xi’an or XinJiang), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.

Find me on
