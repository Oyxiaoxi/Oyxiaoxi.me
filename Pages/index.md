Hi there, I am Oyxiaoxi, a Chinese freelance Full Stack Developer. Teleworking in [<span i-icon-park-bytedance/> ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/).  

Thanks to My friends, I have been asked to work as a remote technical consultant to solve some tricky, complex space, server and underlying code logic work.

Outside of programming, I enjoy doing photography and traveling. Some of my photos can be found on [<span i-simple-icons-instagram /> Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/Oyxiaoxi). If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in BeiJing or Shanghai or Xiâ€™an), maybe we can hang out and take some photos or code together.

And regard the suspicious eyes of others as a ghostly flame, and go boldly on your nightly journey.

Find me on [<span i-simple-icons-github /> GitHub](https://github.com/oyxiaoxi), [<span i-simple-icons-twitter /> Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/oyxiaoxi) , [<span i-simple-icons-sinaweibo /> WeiBo](https://weibo.com/AmOyxiaoxi) <br>
Mail me at [<span i-clarity-email-solid/> hi@oyxiaoxi.me](mailto:hi@oyxiaoxi.me).

You did not return as expected, and that is what parting is all about.
